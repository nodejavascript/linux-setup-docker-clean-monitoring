Title: I released a procedure using 15 docker containers working together for metrics

Excerpt: 1) Use this procedure once, 2) take a snapshot, 3) use as cookie-cutter to grow and save $

## Hello! I just released new open source development.

Go straight to the procedure in [README.md](https://github.com/nodejavascript/linux-setup-docker-clean-monitoring/blob/master/README.md)

It's instructions of knowledge put together to jump start embedded systems analysis, with emphasis on helping the selfhosting community using mqtt done for you.

Included are pre-configurations for ghost blog, tools and databases for api development and lots of smart metrics to provide time series analysis.

### Read the *many* features from this open-source project (my blog article):
